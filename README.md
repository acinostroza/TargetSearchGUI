# TargetSearchGUI

TargetSearch Graphical User Interface

The GUI has been deprecated starting from
[TargetSearch](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/TargetSearch.html)
1.40. In the next release (i.e., 1.42), it will be permanently removed.

This repository contains the GUI's last version and it is open
for further improvements if anyone would like to take step forward
and take care of the development.
